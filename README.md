# Simulation Engine (SFML + C++)

A deterministic 2D physics simulation engine built from scratch using C++ and SFML.

This project focuses on learning and implementing real-time simulation architecture rather than game-specific logic.

## Current Features

- Fixed timestep simulation loop
- Custom Vec2 math system
- Entity-based physics integration
- World manager for entity lifecycle
- Basic rendering pipeline
- Continuous force simulation

## Goals

- Build a stable simulation framework
- Explore emergent behavior and artificial agents
- Develop scalable system-oriented architecture

## Tech Stack

- C++20
- SFML 3
- Visual Studio
- Git/GitHub

## Status

Early development — architecture-first implementation.
